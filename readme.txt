== Compatibility ==

Although this plugin is still in BETA it should work with these other plugins:

* Ultimate Tag Warrior - If you are using WP 2.3+ with native tag support my plugin will use those tags, if you have a lower version and UTW installed it will use those.
* All in One SEO Pack - Make sure you switch of the "Autogenerate descriptions" option for this plugin or you will have two meta descriptions in your page, which can't be good!
* TDO Mini Forms - My plugin will grab the author of the article when it's been submitted through this plugin.
